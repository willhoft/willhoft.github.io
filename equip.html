            <h1>RGW Camera Equipment</h1>
            <p>
                This is the first camera I remember using - a Kodak Brownie.  I used it to take pictures at a Phillies game when
                I was 8 or 9.  I guess it's what got everything started.

                My first camera.  This was a 35mm range-finder camera.  You focused by lining up two
                halves of the image.  It had an f3.5 lens and shutter speeds from about 1/10 to 1/300 of a second.
                There was no light meter in the camera so you had to use a light meter, or just guess (which is
                what I did most of the time.)
                I mostly shot slides with this camera.

                My first SLR (Single Lens Reflex.)  My dad had the 1000DTL so I was able to use the same
                lenses that he used, namely his telephoto lens.  This was the time that I really was getting
                into Black and White photography.  Could shot lots of pictures and since I developed them
                myself it cost me very little.

                Now that I was working at IBM I had money to get my first semi-pro camera.  I purchased not
                only the camera but five other lenses over the next couple years.  All the lenses were fixed
                focus, including a macro lens.

                I found this camera at a pawn shop on Clinton Street in Binghamton, NY.  It is a twin
                lens reflex camera and uses 120 film.  The negatives were large and crystal clear - just
                wonderful in the darkroom.

                My first digital camera.  I told myself that I would still shot film for my "good" pictures, but
                I don't think I took more than a couple rolls after buying this camera.  I had several other digital
                cameras - Canon PowerShots SD1000, S3 IS, and SD1100 IS.  However, none of these cameras satisfied my
                desire for the flexibility of using a true SLR, so...

                My first digital SLR.  This is the camera that I am still using.  I have two zoom lenses the 17-85mm, and the
                75-300mm.  I also have a 50mm, f1.4 for low light shotting, and a 100mm macro lens.  My next purchase
                will be a flash.  My daughter Adrienne, also has a Canon - the T1i, which is part of the Rebel line.
